## CSS reusage code challenge

This project has an awesome CSS code reuse challenge.

## `<blockquote>`

I didn't use `<blockquote>` because, by definition, it defines a section that is quoted from another source. I don't think it is the case here (correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll change it right away).

## The SVG quotes image background

As this is not an important image, I used CSS to place this background. See this [Hints for preloading images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images#preloading-hints).

## font colors

This was very challenging without the figma design file.

## background vs background-color

You must be aware of their differences.

## tailwind

This project would be nice to code with tailwind because of "CSS inside HTML" and the specific details each card has. My first impression was to decise which way to code CSS in this: should I code CSS each card separately or should I re-use CSS classes in each one.

## The grid system at screen size of 720px

To be a bit more hands-on and challenge myself, I tried a different grid approach to set up the layout I wanted. In the end, I used `grid-template-areas`.
