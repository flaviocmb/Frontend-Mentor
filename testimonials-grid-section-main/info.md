## `<blockquote>`

I didn't use `<blockquote>` because it defines a section that is quoted from another source. I don't think it is the case here (correct me if I'm wrong).

## The SVG quotes image background

As this is not an important image, I used CSS to place this background. See this [Hints for preloading images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images#preloading-hints).

## font colors

This was very challenging without the figma design file.
